  <h3>My Journey</h3>
  <p>From humble beginnings to where I am today, my journey 
  has been one of perseverance, passion, and personal growth. 
  I was born and raised in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_refugee_camps"> Saharawi Refugee camp </a> in Algeria, 
  located in Tindouf. Growing up in this challenging environment, 
  I developed a deep curiosity and hunger for knowledge. Despite the 
  obstacles I faced, I never allowed them to define or hold me back.</p>

  <p>Hello, there! My name is Sumaya, and I am proud to have emerged from 
  the Saharawi Refugee camp in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara"> Western Sahara </a>, located in Algeria.
The history of Western Sahara is intertwined with struggle and displacement, 
  as my people sought refuge in the camp after Spain sold Western Sahara to 
  Morocco in 1975. Despite the prolonged wait for a referendum that has yet 
  to happen, my people and I have persevered in the face of adversity. The 
  refugee camp has become a home to me, where my family resides, and we rely 
  on monthly humanitarian aid for survival. While the circumstances were tough, 
  I drew strength from the presence of my loving family. As a spirited and joyful 
  daughter, I owe much of my happiness to my incredible mother.</p>

<p>At the age of 12, I attended a boarding school that kept me away from my family 
  for nine months at a time. Although it was a challenging experience, I learned valuable 
  lessons in self-care and the importance of taking care of others. After spending seven 
  years in these schools, I received a scholarship to study in Norway at <a href="https://uwcrcn.no/"> United World College </a>, 
  which marked a profound turning point in my life. The stark contrast between the refugee camp 
  and Norway was evident in the access to clean water, electricity, technology, and a wealth 
  of resources previously unknown to me. It was during my time at the United World College 
  that I discovered my rights as a female and developed a deep appreciation for the 
  opportunities education could offer.</p>
  
<p>Following my time in Norway, I seized another 
  opportunity to pursue higher education at <a href="https://www.methodist.edu/"> Methodist University </a> in Fayetteville, North 
  Carolina. With an unwavering determination, I graduated with a double major in Computer 
  Science and Computer Information Technology, specializing in Business Administration. 
  Despite the lack of internet access in my homeland and my limited knowledge prior to those 
  four years, I maximized my scholarship to acquire a comprehensive understanding of 
  computers and technology. I hold great admiration for the potential of technology and its 
  impact on the future of humanity. I firmly believe that each of us can contribute to 
  making the world a better place for future generations by striving to make a positive 
  difference every day.</p>
